<p>From earliest times, trees have served and interested
man. Primitive man found trees to be a source of food, fuel,
clothing, and building material. In the dim, distant past
certain trees were considered sacred as the habitat of woodland
deities. Today, some giants of the forest are known
for their great age and as landmarks; they are often associated
with historical events.</p>
<p>The first portion of this pamphlet was published in the
FORT WAYNE SENTINEL on July 11, 1891, and describes
historic trees of the Colonial and Revolutionary periods.
Grammar, spelling, and punctuation have been changed to
correspond with current usage. The second part was written
by the Library Staff; stories of notable trees of the Old
Northwest are related.</p>
<p>The Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort
Wayne and Allen County present this publication in the hope
that it will prove entertaining and informative to citizens of
the Summit City.</p>

<p class="tb">There has been no Methuselah since the flood. Man
seldom lives longer than one hundred years. Only the elephant
and the tortoise feebly imitate the longevity of the antediluvians.
But there are living things that outlive them
all&mdash;things far more stately than the tallest man or largest
quadruped&mdash;living things that were companions of the gray
beards before the flood and lived to bless their grandchildren.</p>
<p>The only living links between us and the remote past
are trees&mdash;grand old trees with clustering memories like
trailing vines. In the shadows of the dark forest, in the light
of the lofty hills, in the warmth and beauty of the broad plains
of the great globe, they stand in matchless dignity. But they
are few. They are patriarchs of the vegetable kingdom, receiving
the homage of myriads of children. With what mute
eloquence do they address us? With what moving pathos do
the trees of Olivet discourse of Jesus, his &ldquo;beautiful life and
sublime death&rdquo;? How the cedars of Lebanon talk of Solomon
and Hiram, and the great temple of Jerusalem! In our own
country and in our own time, ancient trees have been, and
still are, intimately connected with our history as colonies
and as a nation; they command the reverence of every heart.</p>
<p>Probably the most ancient of these living links connecting
the present and the past was the Big Tree that stood on
the bank of the Genesee River, near the village of Geneseo,
New York. When first seen by the white man, it was the
patriarch of the Geneseo Valley and was so revered by the
Senecas that they named their village &ldquo;Big Tree.&rdquo; It also
gave name to an eminent Seneca chief, who was the friend of
Washington and his cause. During a great flood in the Geneseo
Valley in 1857, the Big Tree was swept away and buried
in the bottom of Lake Ontario. The trunk measured twenty-five
feet, nine inches in circumference.</p>
<p>Probably next in age to the Big Tree was the famous
Charter Oak in the city of Hartford, Connecticut. It was
standing at the height of its glory and was estimated to be
six hundred years old when the seeds of the commonwealth
were planted there. Connected with it is a curious episode.
When James II ascended the English throne, he took measures
to suppress the growth of free government in America;
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
he sent over Edmond Andros to take away the charters from
the colonies and to rule over them as governor general. Connecticut
refused to give up her charter. When Andros attempted
to seize it during a night session of the Assembly,
Captain Wadsworth bore the charter away and secreted it in
a hollow of the old oak. After James II had been deposed
and Andros had been banished from New England, the charter
was taken from its hiding place and the government re-established.
On a stormy night in August, 1854, the old oak was
prostrated.</p>
<p>In the Kensington area of Philadelphia, an old elm stood
until 1810, known as Penn&rsquo;s Treaty Tree, because under it
the renowned Quaker made his compact with the Indians. &ldquo;I
will not do as the Marylanders did, that is, call you children
or brothers only,&rdquo; said Penn, addressing the Indians, &ldquo;for
parents are apt to whip their children too severely, and brothers
sometimes will differ; neither will I compare the friendship
between us to a chain for the rain may rust it or a tree
may fall and break it, but I will consider you as the same
flesh and blood with the Christians, and the same as if one
man&rsquo;s body were to be divided into two parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until 1860 a venerable willow tree stood in New York
City and it has an interesting history. When Alexander Pope,
the English poet, built his villa at Twickenham, he planted
a small twig that a friend had sent him from Smyrna. This
little twig of the Salix babylonica, or weeping willow, became
the parent of all its kind in England and in the United States.
One of the British officers who came to Boston in 1775 to
crush the American Revolution carried with him a twig from
Pope&rsquo;s willow to plant on American soil. The twig was presented
to John Parke Custis, Washington&rsquo;s stepson, and was
planted at Abingdon, Virginia. In 1790 General Gates planted
a shoot from it on his farm on Manhattan Island, where it
became in time a beautiful willow, the grandchild of Pope&rsquo;s
willow at Twickenham.</p>
<p>Soon after the great conflict for American independence
had begun, Washington was appointed Commander in Chief
of the continental forces; on July 2, 1775, he took up his
headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following
morning he proceeded to a great elm tree at the north end of
Cambridge Common and drawing his sword, he formally took
command of the army. The old elm tree was known afterward
as Washington&rsquo;s Elm.</p>

<p>Near the dividing line between North and South Carolina
stood a famous tulip tree, marking the spot where the Americans
defeated a part of Lord Cornwallis&rsquo; army in October,
1780. Because ten Tories were hanged from its branches
after the battle, the tree was called afterward the Tory Tulip
Tree.</p>
<p>Until about 1852, a majestic pine tree stood by the
highway between the villages of Fort Edward and Sandy Hill
(now Hudson Falls) on the Hudson in upstate New York. Upon
its trunk was carved &ldquo;Jane McCrea, 1777.&rdquo; The inscription
memorialized the tragic fate of Jane McCrea. The
daughter of a New Jersey clergyman, she moved, after her
father&rsquo;s death, to her brother&rsquo;s home near Fort Edward.
Here she became engaged to a neighbor&rsquo;s son. He was a
loyalist who entered the army of Burgoyne. In 1777, Jane
was captured by Indians and was killed instantly when a bullet
intended for the savages pierced her heart. Her lover
purchased the locks of his beloved, deserted the army, and
retired to Canada, where he bewailed his betrothed&rsquo;s fate
until the end of his life.</p>
<p>In 1779 Washington sent Mad Anthony Wayne to storm
the fort on Stony Point in the Hudson highlands. When asked
by Washington whether he could carry the fort, Wayne replied:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll storm hell if you will only plan it!&rdquo; Under a
black walnut tree, in the stillness of the night, Wayne gave
orders to his men, and as stealthily as tigers they approached
the fort and surprised it. In the early morning Wayne wrote
to the Commander in Chief, &ldquo;The fort and garrison and Colonel
Johnston are ours.&rdquo; The walnut tree has perished.</p>

<p>Near Seaconnet, Rhode Island, stood a venerable sycamore
tree, the only great tree left in that section of the state
by the British when they evacuated it in October, 1779. Seaconnet
Channel was the scene of one of the most dashing exploits
of the War of Independence. The British had blocked
the channel with the warship, &ldquo;Pigot,&rdquo; which was armed
with twelve eight-pounders and ten swivels. Captain Silas
Talbot undertook the capture of the &ldquo;Pigot.&rdquo; Embarking sixty
men on the coasting schooner &ldquo;Hawke&rdquo; which was armed
with only three three-pounders and small arms, he sailed
under cover of darkness. Grappling the enemy, he boarded,
drove the crew below, coiled the cables over the hatchway
to secure his prisoners, and carried off his prize to Stonington.</p>
<p>In Charleston until 1849 there was a beautiful magnolia
tree which spread its branches over more than two hundred
square feet. Under this tree General Benjamin Lincoln held
a council in 1780 to determine whether Charleston, then besieged
by Sir Henry Clinton, should be evacuated. It was
resolved to remain, but a few weeks later the Americans
surrendered to the British, who had been reinforced by Lord
Cornwallis.</p>
<p>At Lake Drummond in the Dismal Swamp in Virginia,
there is a tall tree under which Washington is reputed to have
passed a night in Colonial times.</p>
<p>When Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, visited Norfolk
in 1834, he heard the story of a young man who became mentally
unbalanced on the death of his beloved. Refusing to admit
her death, he believed that she was living deep within
the swamp. Under that impression he wandered into its solitudes
and perished. Moore used this legend as the basis
for his touching ballad &ldquo;The Lake of the Dismal Swamp,&rdquo;
which commences:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They made her a grave, too cold and damp</p>
<p class="t0">For a soul so warm and true;</p>
<p class="t0">And she&rsquo;s gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,</p>
<p class="t0">Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp,</p>
<p class="t0">She paddles her white canoe.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,</p>
<p class="t0">And her paddle I soon shall hear;</p>
<p class="t0">Long and loving our life shall be,</p>
<p class="t0">And I&rsquo;ll hide the maid in a cypress tree,</p>
<p class="t0">When the footstep of death is near.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The last of our historical trees is a white oak in the
eastern part of the village of Flushing on Long Island a few
miles from New York. George Fox, the founder of the Society
of Friends, preached under it in 1672, and afterward
it was held in deep regard by the Quakers.</p>
<p class="tb">FORT WAYNE SENTINEL, July 11, 1891</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p class="tb">Hoosiers and other Midwesterners may well be proud
of the interesting trees of their states. These giants of the
forest are interesting because of closely connected historical
events or because of special facets of their own histories.
Indiana and her neighboring states have produced
great trees worthy of special mention.</p>
<p>The fame of a tree is perpetuated and frequently exaggerated
or altered during its lifetime. The natives consider
the tree as a landmark; they proudly point it out and
relate its history to strangers. All too often when the tree
dies and is felled, it is unfortunately forgotten. The legend
also dies for succeeding generations.</p>
<p>The citizens of Indiana are indeed fortunate that their
most famous tree, the Constitution Elm, has not been allowed
to sink into oblivion. Delegates met at Corydon, Indiana&rsquo;s
first capitol, on June 10, 1816, to draft the first
state constitution. The weather was unseasonably warm;
the heat may have influenced the committee to adjourn to
the shade of a huge elm on the lawn of the Statehouse. Under
these sheltering branches spreading over one hundred
feet, the delegates met each day until they had completed
that historic document on the twenty-ninth of June in that
memorable summer. The elm perished in 1925 from a fatal
root disease, phloem necrosis, but the trunk was preserved
and set in a sandstone monument.</p>
<p>Another elm connected with the political history of
Indiana grew at Plainfield. In 1842 Martin Van Buren toured
the West, and his itinerary included Indianapolis and Terre
Haute with a stop en route at Plainfield. Although 1842 was
not a presidential election year, Van Buren undoubtedly
had in mind the coming nominations of 1844, for he made
speeches at every stop and gave his political opinions freely.
In Indianapolis he was given an enthusiastic reception by his
friends and admirers. But he also had political enemies in
Indiana. The owners of the stage coach lines were incensed
because he had not favorably received legislation for road
improvement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="pcap">the Constitution Elm ... Corydon, Indiana</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>These enemies planned to mar his arrival at Plainfield
and had little trouble bribing the driver of Van Buren&rsquo;s
coach to effect it. The National Road led into Plainfield,
and beside it towered an ancient elm. The massive roots
of the tree extended across the road. As the coach approached
the tree, the driver whipped up the horses instead
of slowing them down. The wheels struck the obstacle; the
impact upset the coach, and Van Buren landed in the muddy
road. His political foes succeeded in spoiling his arrival
at Plainfield and doubtlessly impressed him with the urgent
need for highway improvement! The local chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution has since marked this
elm with a plaque.</p>
<p>The patriarch of Fort Wayne&rsquo;s apple trees was bearing
fruit long before General Wayne appeared on the scene.
When Chief Richardville of the Miami Indians was born in a
hut near the tree in 1761, the apple tree stood in the midst
of the Miami village, Kekionga. The city grew and prospered;
late in the nineteenth century the venerable tree perished
at an estimated age of one hundred and fifty years.
Although the exact location is unknown, it stood in the Lakeside
residential district of Fort Wayne. An article in the
May, 1862, issue of HARPER&rsquo;S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE
reveals that the trunk of the ancient tree measured
twenty feet in diameter in 1860.</p>
<p>New Harmony, Indiana, the scene of two remarkable
social experiments, had two trees worthy of mention. In
1803 the Harmonists, under the leadership of George Rapp,
separated from the Lutheran church in Germany and migrated
to Pennsylvania. In 1815 the sect moved again; the members
decided on a site which they called &ldquo;Harmonie&rdquo; on the Wabash
River in Indiana. Upon disembarking at their destination,
they slept under an oak tree, which was later named
&ldquo;The Rappite Oak.&rdquo; Rapp built his own house near the tree.
The Harmonists were so successful in their communal living
experiment that jealous neighbors made life unpleasant
for them, and they returned to Pennsylvania in 1824. But
the oak survived until 1900 and outlived all of the Harmonists,
whose numbers dwindled rapidly because of their strict
adherence to celibacy.</p>
<p>Robert Owen (1771-1858), another social experimenter,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
purchased the settlement from Rapp and renamed it &ldquo;New
Harmony.&rdquo; Unlike the Harmonists, Owen and his followers
were humanists. Their community did not flourish long,
but while in existence it was the home of a brilliant group
of scientists. Among them were Thomas Say, a noted zoologist,
Thomas Nutthall, a botanist, and William Maclure,
one of the world&rsquo;s outstanding geologists. All three men
are commemorated by an Osage Orange tree planted in New
Harmony in 1826. Say planted the tree and Nutthall conferred
its scientific name, &ldquo;Maclura pomifera,&rdquo; in honor
of Maclure. The tree was still alive in the 1920&rsquo;s, a memorial
to an experiment, which, although short lived, has
had a lasting influence upon American democracy.</p>
<p>Several trees in the Great Lakes area were famous
for their connections with treaty negotiations between the
white settlers and the Indians. Just two days after the signing
of the Declaration of Independence, Alexander and William
Macomb purchased Grosse Ile and several smaller islands
at the mouth of the Detroit River. The Fox and Potawatomi
Indians signed a treaty ceding the islands in return
for tobacco, blankets, and a small sum of money. The document
was signed under a linden tree, which survived the
event a century and a quarter. It was felled by a violent
storm on July 3, 1901; the site has been marked by a tablet.</p>
<p>Relations between the Indians and settlers were not
distinguished by a high code of honor; the unprovoked murders
occasionally committed by both white and red men are
probably the ugliest testimony of that fact. Chief Logan of
the Mingo tribe has immortalized an elm tree by his reply
to just such a treacherous mass murder. In the course of
Dunmore&rsquo;s campaign against the Indians in 1774, Colonel
Cresap had killed all of Logan&rsquo;s relatives in spite of Logan&rsquo;s
unblemished record as a friend of the whites. After this
unwarranted cruelty, the embittered chief joined the battle
against the settlers. The Indians were finally forced to make
peace. Logan, standing beneath an elm tree in Pickaway
County, Ohio, made his famous and moving appeal to Dunmore&rsquo;s
representative:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="876" />
<p class="pcap">patriarch of Fort Wayne&rsquo;s apple trees</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I appeal to any white man to say if he ever entered
Logan&rsquo;s cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if he ever
came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the
course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle
in his camp, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for
the whites that my countrymen pointed as I passed and said,
&lsquo;Logan is the friend of the white man.&rsquo; I had ever thought
to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel
Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked,
murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my
women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in
the veins of any living creature. This called on me for
vengeance. I have sought it. I have killed many. I have
fully glutted my vengeance. For my country I rejoice at the
beams of peace; but don&rsquo;t harbor a thought that mine is the
joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his
heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan?
Not one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Webster County, Kentucky, a tree acquired a sinister
reputation because of its association with an infamous
criminal. Two notorious brothers, Micajah and Wiley Harpe,
came to Kentucky from North Carolina in 1799. Commonly
known as &ldquo;Big Harpe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Harpe,&rdquo; the men left a
trail of murder and plunder as they moved across the state.
Arrested and imprisoned for murder, the desperadoes escaped
and killed a boy and three men. They finally climaxed
their crimes by murdering an entire family of women and
children.</p>
<p>The outraged citizens, led by Captain Leeper, organized
a posse and rode in search of the outlaws. One of the
party was Mr. Stigall, the husband and father of the last
group of victims. The posse overtook the brothers in Webster
County, at a point near the junction of Union and Henderson
counties. Captain Leeper shot and wounded &ldquo;Big
Harpe,&rdquo; and Mr. Stigall killed him; but &ldquo;Little Harpe&rdquo; escaped
unharmed.</p>
<p>The incensed men decapitated Harpe, and impaled his
head on a sharpened sapling growing nearby. The tree continued
to grow, branching around its shortened trunk. Underneath
the head, a face was later carved into the bole of
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the tree. The sculptured effigy remained clearly visible
until the landmark was hewn down nearly a century later.
The tree grew beside the intersection of roads from Henderson,
Hopkinsville, and Morganfield, and the crossroads
became known as &ldquo;Harpe&rsquo;s Head.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
